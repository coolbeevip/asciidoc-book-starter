== Writing Your Book

AsciiDoc offers expressive features for structuring content. Here are some quick reminders to get started:

=== Sections and numbering

Use `==` for chapters and `===` for sub-sections. Section numbering is enabled globally via the `:sectnums:` attribute in `book.adoc`.

=== Code listings

[source,ruby]
----
puts 'Hello, reader!'
----

Add the `[source,<language>]` block for syntax highlighting.

=== Images

image::example-diagram.png[Example diagram, width=75%]

Place images under `assets/images/` and update the filename accordingly.

=== Callouts and tips

[NOTE]
====
Callouts, admonitions, and sidebars help highlight key information for readers.
====

Add your own writing guidelines or conventions to this chapter as your book evolves.
