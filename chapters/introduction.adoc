== Introduction

Welcome to your AsciiDoc book project. This template provides a sensible structure for writing technical or narrative books using Asciidoctor.

* Keep chapters in the `chapters/` directory.
* Use appendices in the `appendices/` directory for supplementary material.
* Add images to `assets/images/` and reference them with the `image::` macro.

This starter is intentionally lightweight so you can focus on writing while keeping build tooling simple and transparent.
