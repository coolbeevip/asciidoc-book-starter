== Setting Up Your Environment

To render this book locally you need Ruby and the Asciidoctor toolchain. The Makefile in this repository assumes you have `asciidoctor` and `asciidoctor-pdf` installed.

. Install dependencies (if you do not have them):
+
[source,bash]
----
gem install asciidoctor asciidoctor-pdf
----

. Build an HTML version of the book:
+
[source,bash]
----
make html
----

. Build a PDF version of the book:
+
[source,bash]
----
make pdf
----

If you prefer another toolchain, adjust the Makefile or provide your own build scripts to match your environment.
