== Publishing and Distribution

After drafting your content, decide how you want to distribute the book. Asciidoctor supports multiple output formats:

* **HTML** for hosting on the web
* **PDF** for print-ready copies
* **EPUB** for e-readers using additional tools such as `asciidoctor-epub3`

You can also integrate the Makefile with continuous integration to produce artifacts on every push. Consider adding steps to upload the generated files to your preferred hosting provider.
